HTML tells the computer what we want it to do for our website
<button>"text"</button>
    This creates a button on a website for you to see and interact with
<p>"text"</p>
    This creates a paragraph of text on the website
Where the code written effects the location on the website
The computer follows our instructions line by line

Syntax is rules for writing code (grammar for code)
<"tag name"> = openeing tag
</"tag name"> = closing tag

<a> = anchor element (link to another website)
href="(link)" tells the anchor element where to go
target="_blank" sends the link to another page

HTML ignores spacing so make sure to make your code neat and organized

CSS is styling our website (Change the appearance of HTML elements)

<style> will allow you to change colors on your button or your element

<style> then wrtie the element you'd like to adjust

class="" allows you to label an element

General Technique:
    1. Create element with HTML
    2. Style with CSS one-by-one

margin is how to add space

The trick with round buttons is to set the border-radius to half of the height or width whichever is lower
<style>
    ."class" {}
        color is text
        background-color is background
        cursor: pointer is pointer finger
        margin is how to add spacing
        font-weight: is bold or italisized
        border-radius is the curved edges on the buttons
            border radius should be half of the lowest px whether height or width whichever is lowest

."class":hover is how to change the button when hovering over
."class":active changes how it looks when you interact with the button

opacity: changes how see thru the button looks
    changing the opacity makes the button look lighter like on the subscribe button
    the values are 0-1
        1 being the highest (completly normal)
        0 being the lowest (completly see thru)

transition: "property" (x)s
    0.15s is a generally good speed for transitions

you can transition muliple properties by adding a comma after the previous property

To make shadows on the button you do box-shadow
    box-shadow: (+-x) (+-y) (z) "rbga"
        x is horizontal position
        y is vertical position
        z is blurr
